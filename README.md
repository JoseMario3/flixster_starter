### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, this week has fully prepped me to complete this project. A couple times Monday - Wednesday I became frustrated that I couldn't get certain functions working in the labs. However, this whole time I have understood everything I needed to accomplish. I feel I was able to build on what I had struggled with before and create a great website, from styling a website well, to using for Each loops, to calling APIs. I felt prepared to complete all the features.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, the first thing I would do is put much more time into css styling. I believe the way a website looks is essential in whether a user spends much time on the website or not. I also know the best way to get better at styling is to put a lot of practice into it, so I would use more time to make the site look amazing. Afterwards, I would go ahead and try to add some of the stretch features I didn't get to finish.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
